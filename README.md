# GSoC-PINNDE

### This is my solution of the task given for the project titled "Physics-Informed Neural Network Diffusion Equation (PINNDE)" by GENIE @ ML4SCI under GSoC'25

* pinn-de-final-submission.ipynb &rarr; notebook containing all approached, data generation and results
* Simple_PINN.pth &rarr; model weights for approach 1
* PINN_Fourier.pth &rarr; model weights for another approach 2

### Notebook is well written, highlighting all the results with proper explanation of workflow and all the approaches
