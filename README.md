# GSoC-PINNDE

### This is my solution of the task given for the project titled "Physics-Informed Neural Network Diffusion Equation (PINNDE)" by GENIE @ ML4SCI under GSoC'25

* pinn-de-final-submission -> notebook containing all approached, data generation and results
* Simple_PINN.pth -> model weights for one of the approach
* PINN_Fourier.pth -> model weights for another approach
